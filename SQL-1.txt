.............SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. 

*SQL Server
It is primarily designed and developed to compete with MySQL and Oracle database. 
SQL Server supports ANSI SQL, which is the standard SQL (Structured Query Language) language. 
However, SQL Server comes with its own implementation of the SQL language, T-SQL (Transact-SQL).

*T-SQL is a Microsoft propriety Language known as Transact-SQL. 
It provides further capabilities of declaring variable, exception handling, stored procedure, etc.

*A CLIENT is an application that sends requests to the MS SQL SERVER installed on a given machine. 
The SERVER is capable of processing input data as requested. 
Finally, respond with PROCESSED OUTPUT DATA as a result.

*main components and services of SQL server:
-Database Engine: This component handle storage, Rapid transaction Processing, and Securing Data.

-SQL Server: This service starts, stops, pauses, and continues an instance of Microsoft SQL Server. 
			 Executable name is sqlservr.exe.

-SQL Server Agent: It performs the role of Task Scheduler. 
				   It can be triggered by any event or as per demand. 
				   Executable name is sqlagent.exe.

-SQL Server Browser: This listens to the incoming request and connects to the desired SQL server instance. 
					 Executable name is sqlbrowser.exe.

-SQL Server Full-Text Search: This lets user running full-text queries against Character data in SQL Tables.
							  Executable name is fdlauncher.exe.

-SQL Server VSS Writer: This allows backup and restoration of data files when the SQL server is not running.
						Executable name is sqlwriter.exe.

-SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS): Provide Data analysis, Data mining and Machine Learning capabilities. 
									  SQL server is integrated with R and Python language for advanced analytics. 
									  Executable name is msmdsrv.exe.

-SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS): Provides reporting features and decision-making capabilities. 
									   It includes integration with Hadoop. Executable name is ReportingServicesService.exe.

-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): Provided Extract-Transform and Load capabilities of the different type of data from one source to another. 
										 It can be view as converting raw information into useful information. Executable name is MsDtsSrvr.exe.


*SQL Server Instances
-Primary Instances
-Named Instances
#There are two ways through which we may access the primary instance. 
 First, we can use the server name. Secondly, we can use its IP address. 
 Named instances are accessed by appending a backslash and instance name.

*Importance of SQL Server Instances
1. For installation of different versions on one machine
2. For cost reduction
3. For maintenance of development, production and test environments separately
4. For reducing temporary database problems
5. For separating security privileges
6. For maintaining a standby server


**Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is an extension of SQL which is used in SQL Server. 
 The Transact-SQL or T-SQL is closely integrated into the SQL language, 
 it also adds programming constructs that are not native to SQL.
 
** A DBMS is a software that is used to manage the database
*a DBMS basically serves as an interface between the batabase and its end-users or programs, allowing
 users to retrieve, update, and manage how the informationis organized and optimized.
 
 **types
 -hierarchical DBMS
 -network DBMS
 -relational DBMS
 -object-oriented DBMS
 
*SQL(Structured query language)
-A stdized programming language which is used for managing relational databases
-with SQL,you can modify databases ,add ,update, or delete rows of data,retrievesubsets of information from a database and any more
-relational database like MySQL database ,oracle,MS MySQL,Sybase etc use SQL.
-Queries and other sql operation are written as statement.eg:select,insert,add,update,delete,create,alert,truncate.


*sql command categories
1. data definition language command(DDL)-consist of the commands used to define the schema.
2. data manipulation language commands-  deals with the manipulation of data present in database.
3. data control language commands-- deals with the rights, permission and controls of the database system.
4. transaction control language commands- consist of commands which deals with the transaction of database.
 
*sql server data types
- exact numeric
-approx. numeric
-date and time
-character strings
-unicode character strings
-binary strings
-other data types

**keys in DATABASE
-candidate Key
- super key
- primery  key
- alternate key
-foreign key

**constraints in database
-not well--ensure that a null value cannot be stored in a cloumn
-unique--this makes sure that all the values in a column are different.
-check--this ensure that all the values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
-default--this consist of set of default values for the a column when no values is specified.
-index-- this is used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.

**MERGE**
-the merge statement is used to perform the insert,update, and delete operations on a specific table,where the source table is provided
----syntax

MERGE TargetTableName USING SourceTableName
ON MergeCondition
WHEN MATCHED
THEN Update_Statement
WHEN NOT MATCHED
THEN Inser_Statement
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY Source
THEN DELETE;

**Indexes in SQL Server
-Indexes make the search operation faster by creating something called a B-Tree (Balanced Tree) structure internally. 
-Whenever the database engine wants to retrieve the data from a database table it will adopt two different mechanisms for searching the data
		1.Table scan------ If the table having more rows, then it will take more time for searching the required data, so it is a time-consuming process.
		2.Index Scan/Seek--In Index Scan, the SQL Server Search Engine uses a B-Tree structure 
						   to search the required data which drastically improves the performance of your search query by reducing the number of scans.

**B-Tree (Balanced Tree)
-Whenever you create an index (or indexes) on some column(s) of a table in SQL Server then what happens internally is, it creates a B-Tree structure. 
In the B-Tree structure, the data is divided into three sections i.e. 
-Root Node, 
-Non-Leaf Nodes, and
-Leaf Nodes.

**What is an Index in SQL Server?
-It is a database object in SQL Server which is used to improve the performance of search operations.
-When we create an index on any column of a table, then SQL Server internally maintains a separate table called index table. 
 And when we are trying to retrieve the data from the existing table, depends on the index table, SQL Server directly goes to the table and retrieves the data very quickly.
-In a table, we can use a maximum of 250 indexes.

**When SQL Server uses Indexes?
The SQL Server uses indexes of a table provided that the select or update or delete statement contained the “WHERE” clause and moreover the 
where condition column must be an indexed column. 
If the select statement contains an “ORDER BY” clause then also the indexes can be used.

Note: When SQL Server is searching for information under the database, 
first it will verify the best execution plan for retrieving the data and 
uses that plan which can be either a full-page scan and index scan.

*****
The syntax for creating an Index in SQL Server:

CREATE [UNIQUE] [CLUSTERED/ NON-CLUSTERED] INDEX <INDEX NAME> ON <TABLE NAME> (<COLUMN LIST>)
*****


**types of indexes**

1.Clustered index
-The Clustered Index in SQL Server defines the order in which the data is physically stored in a table. 
-In the case of a clustered index,  the leaf node store the actual data. 
-As the leaf nodes store the actual data a table can have only one clustered index. 
-The Clustered Index by default was created when we created the primary key constraint for that table. 
-That means the primary key column creates a clustered index by default.
-When a table has a clustered index then that table is called a clustered table. -
If a table has no clustered index its data rows are stored in an unordered structure.

2.Non-Clustered Index,
-In SQL Server Non-Clustered Index, the arrangement of data in the index table will be different from the arrangement of data in the actual table. 
-The data is stored in one place and the index is stored in another place. 
-Moreover, the index will have pointers to the storage location of the actual data.
