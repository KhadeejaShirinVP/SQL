.............SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. 

*SQL Server
It is primarily designed and developed to compete with MySQL and Oracle database. 
SQL Server supports ANSI SQL, which is the standard SQL (Structured Query Language) language. 
However, SQL Server comes with its own implementation of the SQL language, T-SQL (Transact-SQL).

*T-SQL is a Microsoft propriety Language known as Transact-SQL. 
It provides further capabilities of declaring variable, exception handling, stored procedure, etc.

*A CLIENT is an application that sends requests to the MS SQL SERVER installed on a given machine. 
The SERVER is capable of processing input data as requested. 
Finally, respond with PROCESSED OUTPUT DATA as a result.

*main components and services of SQL server:
-Database Engine: This component handle storage, Rapid transaction Processing, and Securing Data.

-SQL Server: This service starts, stops, pauses, and continues an instance of Microsoft SQL Server. 
			 Executable name is sqlservr.exe.

-SQL Server Agent: It performs the role of Task Scheduler. 
				   It can be triggered by any event or as per demand. 
				   Executable name is sqlagent.exe.

-SQL Server Browser: This listens to the incoming request and connects to the desired SQL server instance. 
					 Executable name is sqlbrowser.exe.

-SQL Server Full-Text Search: This lets user running full-text queries against Character data in SQL Tables.
							  Executable name is fdlauncher.exe.

-SQL Server VSS Writer: This allows backup and restoration of data files when the SQL server is not running.
						Executable name is sqlwriter.exe.

-SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS): Provide Data analysis, Data mining and Machine Learning capabilities. 
									  SQL server is integrated with R and Python language for advanced analytics. 
									  Executable name is msmdsrv.exe.

-SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS): Provides reporting features and decision-making capabilities. 
									   It includes integration with Hadoop. Executable name is ReportingServicesService.exe.

-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): Provided Extract-Transform and Load capabilities of the different type of data from one source to another. 
										 It can be view as converting raw information into useful information. Executable name is MsDtsSrvr.exe.


*SQL Server Instances
-Primary Instances
-Named Instances
#There are two ways through which we may access the primary instance. 
 First, we can use the server name. Secondly, we can use its IP address. 
 Named instances are accessed by appending a backslash and instance name.

**featuresof sql server
-user experience
-availability
-performance
-analytics
-security
-buisness intelligence

-----install sql server---->connect to sql server using SSMS------->Access Database Engine  

*Importance of SQL Server Instances
1. For installation of different versions on one machine
2. For cost reduction
3. For maintenance of development, production and test environments separately
4. For reducing temporary database problems
5. For separating security privileges
6. For maintaining a standby server


**Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is an extension of SQL which is used in SQL Server. 
 The Transact-SQL or T-SQL is closely integrated into the SQL language, 
 it also adds programming constructs that are not native to SQL.
 
** A DBMS is a software that is used to manage the database
*a DBMS basically serves as an interface between the batabase and its end-users or programs, allowing
 users to retrieve, update, and manage how the informationis organized and optimized.
 
 **types
 -hierarchical DBMS
 -network DBMS
 -relational DBMS
 -object-oriented DBMS
 
*SQL(Structured query language)
-A stdized programming language which is used for managing relational databases
-with SQL,you can modify databases ,add ,update, or delete rows of data,retrievesubsets of information from a database and any more
-relational database like MySQL database ,oracle,MS MySQL,Sybase etc use SQL.
-Queries and other sql operation are written as statement.eg:select,insert,add,update,delete,create,alert,truncate.


*sql command categories
1. data definition language command(DDL)-consist of the commands used to define the schema.
2. data manipulation language commands-  deals with the manipulation of data present in database.
3. data control language commands-- deals with the rights, permission and controls of the database system.
4. transaction control language commands- consist of commands which deals with the transaction of database.
 
*sql server data types
- exact numeric
-approx. numeric
-date and time
-character strings
-unicode character strings
-binary strings
-other data types

**keys in DATABASE
-candidate Key
- super key
- primery  key
- alternate key
-foreign key

**constraints in database
-not well--ensure that a null value cannot be stored in a cloumn
-unique--this makes sure that all the values in a column are different.
-check--this ensure that all the values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
-default--this consist of set of default values for the a column when no values is specified.
-index-- this is used to create and retrievedata from the databse very quickly.
